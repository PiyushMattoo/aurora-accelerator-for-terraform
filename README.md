# Terraform Modules

Here's how you can automate deployment of Amazon Aurora and related resources following AWS best practices.


## Deployment Procedure

To deploy the Terraform Amazon Aurora module, do the following:

1. Install Terraform. For instructions and a video tutorial, see [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

2. [Install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and [configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

3. If you don't have git installed, [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

4. Clone this ** awsdabra/aurora-accelerator-for-terraform** repository using the following command:

   `git clone https://github.com/awsdabra/aurora-accelerator-for-terraform.git`

5. Change directory to the root repository directory.

   `cd aurora-accelerator-for-terraform/`


6. Deploy Aurora Terraform module.
   1. To create VPC and deploy Aurora module
      - Initialize the deploy directory. Run `terraform init`.
      - Start a Terraform run using the configuration files (deploy.tf) in your deploy directory. 

7. The below demonstrates how you can leverage Aurora Blueprints to deploy an Aurora global cluster. Modify the paramaters below in the deploy.tf located in the top level folder. 

	a) Create a VPC with three availability zones (AZ) with a subnet in each AZ. 

	b) To use existing VPC subnet ids, update the locals below for the primary region and secondary region in the deploy.tf.   

	c) Also set the password to null to generate a new random password

	d) Update the data section with the subnet cidrs in the primary and secondary region. 

	e) Update the primary and secondary regions in the providers.tf file.  

	f) Run Terraform apply
